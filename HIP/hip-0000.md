## Abstract

This HIP proposes to expose the SHA384 hash of the decompressed record file already present in the Mirror Node's DB using the REST APIs via the `/api/v1/blocks` endpoints.

## Motivation

To make it easier to download, store, and share record files, it's important to be able to follow a trusted mirror node.
The ability to easily verify that the downloaded record files match the canonical chain exposed by a trusted mirror node is a step in this direction.

## Rationale

The current Mirror Node REST API `/api/v1/blocks` endpoints provide information about the Hedera record file (or virtual blocks).

The data returned includes the record file name, but not its hash. The only hashes present in the result are the `hash` and `previous_hash` fields, which represent the hash of a portion of the contents of the record file.

The SHA384 hash of the decompressed record file is already computed and stored in the Mirror Node's DB (`file_hash` column) during the record file import operations, so exposing this value via the REST APIs does not affect service performance.

## User stories

- As a mirror node operator, I want to verify that a record file I own or have downloaded is included and verified in the canonical chain by another mirror node.
  
## Specification

The `/api/v1/blocks` and `/api/v1/blocks/{hashOrNumber}` endpoints should return an additional `file_hash` field containing the SHA384 hash of the decompressed record file.

## Backwards Compatibility

The `file_hash` field is added to the response payload of the `/api/v1/blocks` endpoints. This HIP does not modify any existing field, so the modification should be fully backward compatible with any existing application.

## Security Implications

This HIP does not introduce any security concerns to the current Mirror Node's REST API service.

## How to Teach This

The HIP is pretty straightforward: just update the documentation to make people aware of the additional field.

## Reference Implementation

This is an example of the expected payload of `/api/v1/blocks` endpoints after applying this HIP:
